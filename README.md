The code you provided is a Python script that fetches questions from an API endpoint, creates a PDF document containing the questions, and sends the questions via email. Here's a breakdown of the code:

The code imports necessary modules such as requests, pdfkit, smtplib, and MIMEText.

The variable num_questions is set to determine the number of questions to fetch from the API.

The fetch_questions function uses the requests library to fetch the questions from the specified API endpoint. It retrieves the response as JSON and extracts the necessary data.

The create_pdf function generates an HTML content string by iterating through the questions and extracting their details. It uses the pdfkit library to convert the HTML content into a PDF document.

The send_email function is responsible for sending the extracted questions via email. It uses the smtplib library to connect to an SMTP server, login, and send the email. The email's content is created using the email.mime.text.MIMEText class.

The main function is the entry point of the script. It prompts the user to enter the API endpoint URL, their name, and email address. Then it calls the fetch_questions function to retrieve the questions, generates the text content for the email, creates the PDF document using create_pdf, and sends the email using send_email.

Finally, the script checks if it's being run as the main module (__name__ == "__main__") and calls the main function accordingly.

To use this script, you need to have the necessary dependencies installed (requests, pdfkit, smtplib) and provide the API endpoint URL, your name, and email address when prompted. The script will fetch the questions from the API, create a PDF document, and send an email with the extracted questions.

Please note that for the script to work correctly, you need to have the appropriate API endpoint URL that returns the questions in the expected format. Additionally, you may need to provide the path to the wkhtmltopdf executable in the create_pdf function's config variable, depending on your system configuration.
